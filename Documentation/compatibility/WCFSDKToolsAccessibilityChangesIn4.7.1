##Improved accessibility for some .NET SDK tools

###Scope
Edge
###Version Introduced
.NET Framework 4.7.1
###Source Analyzer Status
NotPlanned
###Change Description
In .NET Framework SDK 4.7.1, svcconfigedit.exe and svctraceviewer.exe tools have been improved by fixing varied accessibility issues. Most of these were small issues like a name not being defined or certain UI Automation patterns not being implemented correctly. While many users wouldnâ€™t be aware of these incorrect values, for customers who use assistive technologies like screen readers, they will find these SDK tools become more accessible. Certainly, these fixes change some previous behaviors, like keyboard focus order. 
###Quirked:
In order to get all the accessibility fixes in these tools, you can add App config file with the following configuration:
<runtime>
  <AppContextSwitchOverrides value="Switch.UseLegacyAccessibilityFeatures=false"/>
</runtime>
###Affected APIs
