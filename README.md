# .NET Home

The .NET Home repository is the starting point to engage in and learn about [.NET open source projects](https://github.com/Microsoft?query=dotnet) on GitHub. You read the more detailed [Introduction to .NET Open Source](http://blogs.msdn.com/dotnet) on the .NET blog.

## What are these Projects?

These [projects](https://github.com/Microsoft?query=dotnet) will contain the source code for Microsoft's .NET Core  5 product. Each one of these projects contains the source for a [.NET NuGet package](http://www.nuget.org/profiles/dotnetframework) that is part of .NET Core 5. A few higher-level libraries (ex: [SIMD](http://github.com/microsoft/dotnet-simd)) are available now, and the rest will be added in the coming months. 

## What are ASP.NET Core 5 and .NET Core 5?
 
[ASP.NET Core 5](https://github.com/aspnet/home) is a new version of ASP.NET that runs on Windows, Linux and Mac. .NET Core 5 provides the cross-platform runtime and framework for ASP.NET Core 5. ASP.NET Core 5 and .NET Core 5 are open source on GitHub.
