# .NET Home

The dotnet repository is the starting point to engage in and learn about .NET
open source projects from [Microsoft](http://microsoft.github.io) and the
[.NET Foundation](http://dotnet.github.io). You can read the more detailed
[.NET Core is Open Source](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/dotnet/archive/2014/11/12/net-core-is-open-source.aspx)
on the .NET blog.

## Finding .NET Open Source Projects

There are several open source .NET projects from Microsoft on GitHub and
CodePlex, including:

* [ASP.NET 5](https://github.com/aspnet/home)
* [EntityFramework](https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFramework)
* [.NET Core 5](https://github.com/dotnet/core)
* [.NET Compiler Platform ("Roslyn")](https://roslyn.codeplex.com)

Each one of these projects maps to one or more
[.NET NuGet packages](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/dotnet/p/nugetpackages.aspx)
that are published on [NuGet.org](http://nuget.org/).

There are also many great open source .NET community projects, such as:

* [Mono Project](https://github.com/mono/)
* [JSON.NET](http://json.net/)
* [MVVM Cross](https://github.com/MvvmCross/MvvmCross)
* [MVVM Light Toolkit](http://www.mvvmlight.net)
* [Glimpse](http://getglimpse.com)
* [MonoGame](http://monogame.net)

## How to Engage, Contribute and Provide Feedback

.NET open source projects from Microsoft (gladly) accept PRs and other
contributions. To contribute to ASP.NET 5 or EntityFramework, see
[the ASP.NET Contributing Guide](https://github.com/aspnet/Home/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
To contribute to .NET Core 5, see the
[.NET Core Contributing Guide](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/wiki/Contributing).

You are also encouraged to start a discussion by posting on the
[.NET Foundation Forums](http://forums.dotnetfoundation.org/) or filing an issue
in the corresponding GitHub project. See the contributing guides for more
details.

## .NET Foundation

Most .NET open source projects at Microsoft have been contributed to the
[.NET Foundation](http://www.dotnetfoundation.org/projects). There are two main
.NET Foundation projects for Microsoft open source projects:
[ASP.NET Core 5 project](http://www.dotnetfoundation.org/aspnet-vnext)
and the [.NET Core 5 project](http://www.dotnetfoundation.org/netcore5).
