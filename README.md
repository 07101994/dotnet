# .NET Home

The dotnet repository is the starting point to engage in and learn about .NET open source projects from Microsoft and part of the .NET Foundation. You can read the more detailed [Introduction to .NET Open Source](http://blogs.msdn.com/dotnet) on the .NET blog. 

## License

All .NET open source projects are licensed under either the [MIT](LICENSE) or [Apache 2](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) licenses for code. Some projects license documentation and other forms of content under [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). See specific projects to understand the license used.

## .NET Foundation

All projects have been contributed to the [.NET Foundation](http://www.dotnetfoundation.org/projects). There are two main .NET Foundation projects for Microsoft open source projects: [ASP.NET Core 5 project](http://www.dotnetfoundation.org/prjaspnetvnext.aspx) and the [.NET Core 5 project](http://www.dotnetfoundation.org/prjaspnetvnext.aspx). 

## How to Engage, Contribute and Provide Feedback

All projects (gladly) accept PRs and other contributions. To contribute to ASP.NET 5 or EntityFramework, see [the ASP.NET Contributing Guide](https://github.com/aspnet/Home/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). To contribute to .NET Core 5, see the [.NET Core Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).

You are also encouraged to start a discussion by filing an issue or creating a gist. See the contributing guides for more details. You can discuss .NET OSS more generally in the [.NET Foundation forums](http://www.dotnetfoundation.org/).

## Finding .NET Projects from Microsoft on GitHub

There are several open source .NET projects from Microsoft on GitHub, including [ASP.NET 5](https://github.com/aspnet/home), [Entity Framework](https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFramework) and .NET Core 5. Each one of these projects maps to one or more [.NET NuGet package](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/dotnet/p/nugetpackages.aspx) that are published on [NuGet.org](http://nuget.org/). They are also many great open source .NET community projects on GitHub and Codeplex, including the [Mono Project](https://github.com/mono/).

## Learning about ASP.NET Core 5 and .NET Core 5
 
ASP.NET Core 5 is a new cross-platform version of ASP.NET that is designed for the cloud. It uses the .NET Core 5 runtime and framework, which runs on Windows, Linux and Mac. [ASP.NET Core 5](https://github.com/aspnet/home) and [.NET Core 5 libraries](https://github.com/Microsoft?query=dotnet) are open source on GitHub. At present, only a few [.NET Core 5 libraries](https://github.com/Microsoft?query=dotnet) (ex: [SIMD](http://github.com/microsoft/dotnet-simd)) have been posted on GitHub. The rest of the libraries including the base runtime will be added in the coming months.
